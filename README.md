# Creational Design Pattern :
## Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class
<h3><a href="abstract_factory">1- Abstract Factory</a></h3>
<li>
is a creational design pattern that lets you
produce families of related objects without specifying their

<h3><a href="builder_pattern">2- Builder Pattern</a></h3>
<li>
is a creational design pattern that lets you construct

<h3><a href="factory_method">3- Factory Method </a></h3>
<li>
is a creational design pattern that provides
an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows

<h3><a href="prototype_pattern">4- Prototype Pattern</a></h3>
<li>
is a creational design pattern that lets you copy
existing objects without making your code dependent on
their classes

<h3><a href="singleton_pattern">5- Singleton Pattern</a></h3>
<li>

that a class has only one instance, while providing a global
access point to this instance
